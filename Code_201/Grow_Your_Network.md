# Grow Your Network

Read an article on [“How many jobs are found through networking, really?”][1].

Schedule and attend a 1:1 informational interview with an someone already on your network. Keep it casual and professional. This is perfect time to learn more about what impact the person is making professionally, practice your pitch, and learn how you might be able to help that person. Submit that person’s name with a short summary of what you learned about that person and how you can help them.
