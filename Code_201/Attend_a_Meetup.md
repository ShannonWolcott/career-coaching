# Attend A Meetup

Before the end of the course, you are to attend one meetup event at one of the local meetup groups. For more details about these, check the adjacent [Community-Involvement.md](Community-Involvement.md) document in this directory.

Take a screenshot of your RSVP to the meetup group event. You are to include this screenshot as a file upload along with your report of the event, outlined below.

**If you went to a larger monthy meetup:** Submit in text field in Canvas the titles of the talks you heard and (at least) two people you met, where (if) they work, and what they do there. Write about what you found interesting (or uninteresting) about the subject matter of the talks, as well as anything else notable about the meetup.

**If you went to a programming/hack night:** Submit in text what you worked on, (at least) two people you met, where they work, and what they do there. If you had any interesting conversations or anyone provided you with some significant help, note that as well.

Be verbose! You live in a tech hub, and we want to know all about your exposure to the local programming community!
