# Professional Competency Self-Assessment

We have worked with our partner companies to compile a comprehensive list of competencies (and the proficiencies they are composed of) desired in software developer candidates.

Learn and understand the terms from the master list of competencies.

As a professional you are expected to show our staff and potential employers the ability to exercise these professional competencies and proficiencies. Employers want excellence - not casual. Lacking in these areas is the number one obstacle to getting placed.

You will be evaluating yourself on these competencies and proficiencies during each course and receiving feedback from your instructor on your blind-spots and areas that need improvement in efforts to support your journey to land a job in tech.
