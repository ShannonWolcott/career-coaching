# Prepare Your Resume

Follow these steps on how to create, refine, and upload your resume: 
 
1. Choose a preferred template from one of these [pre-approved Code Fellows templates][1].
  
1. Make a copy of the template (under "File - make a copy) that you would like to use and put it into your “my drive” in your Google.docs. Rename the document using this naming convention “Jane Jackson - Resume”. 

1. Fill out the template with your information or copy and paste from a prior resume with update information. 

1. Follow [this example][2] that outlines the approved standard resume for a software developer.

1. When all edits are complete, add the Campus Director (brandy@codefellows.com) as an editor, by following these steps. 
    1. Click the blue share button at the top right of the doc
    1. Enter brandy@codefellows.com, give edit permissions and click done
        - Note: Only these templates are accepted by Code Fellows when sharing your resume with our partner companies. 

Now: download your shiny new resume as a PDF, and upload it in Canvas to submit your assignment.
